# CatLikeCoding.Clock
Unity tutorial animating a clock - https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/game-objects-and-scripts/

## Includes
- Adding and positioning 3d shapes in Unity (Cylinder and Cubes)
- Altering scales to shape the objects
- Positioning the object based on hierarchy/parent-child relation
- Animating the objects to reflect the current time

## Summary
A main object consisting of a 'clockface' (flat cylinder), 'hourindicators' (small cubes)
and 3 'arms' (narrow, long cubes) is made to look like a clock.

The Update function then uses the current system time to set the position of 
these individual components to resemble the current time.
